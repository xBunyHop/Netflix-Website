## Additional Info
<br />
When i was making this website I used Opera, 75% view. (Resolution ~ 1300x700)
<br />
I suggest you using the same when checking it out. (Website isn't transparent)
<br />
I was unable to upload files via github desktop so I had to upload them manually as a zip archive. (Sorry about that)
<br /><br />
All the banners & descriptions were obtained from original <a href="https://netflix.com">Netflix</a> website.<br />
Some of the  designs are inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw">Web Dev Simplified</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog">Online Tutorials</a> youtube channels.<br />
