* **Additional Info**
When i was making this website I've used opera gx, 75% view.
I suggest you using the same when checking it out. (Website isn't transparent)

All the banners & descriptions were obtained from original [Netflix](https://netflix.com) website.
Some of the  designs are inspired by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) & [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog) youtube channels.
