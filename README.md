I suggest you using the same when checking it out. (Website isn't transparent)

All the banners & descriptions were obtained from original [Netflix](https://netflix.com) website.<br />
Some of the  designs are inspired by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) & [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog) youtube channels.<br />
